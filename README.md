Revenue Milestones from Facebook coding practice problems
https://www.facebookrecruiting.com/portal/coding_practice_question/?problem_id=192049171861831

the day associated with the revenue for when the milestone was achieved.

If interested in my approach and comments I invite you to read the following post in my blog:

Enjoy;
